# CS 250 Module Eight Journal – Portfolio Reflection

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by engaging stakeholders and translating their goals into actionable user stories. User stories provide clarity by defining what a feature should do and the acceptance criteria for completion. This makes it easier for developers to translate requirements into code and ensures the final product aligns with what the user actually values.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development iteratively, using short sprints to deliver small, working pieces of software that can be tested and refined. Agile processes such as sprint planning, backlog grooming, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives are methods I plan to continue using in future work. These practices keep the team aligned, promote adaptability, and allow us to deliver value quickly while responding to changes in requirements.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is reliable, communicative, and collaborative. In software development, this means sharing knowledge, helping teammates when challenges arise, and providing constructive feedback during retrospectives. It also means being adaptable when priorities shift and maintaining accountability to the team. Trust and collaboration are essential to ensure the team consistently delivers high-quality software.
